## Project overview
This project analyzes hotel service quality in Kazakhstan using data mining techniques. Structured hotel characteristics and aggregated user ratings were explored to identify
key factors influencing customer satisfaction.

## Datasets

The project uses two datasets:

- **Hotels dataset** – hotel-level characteristics such as:
  - location and city
  - price related attributes
  - ratings
  - amenities indicators

- **Reviews dataset** – aggregated user ratings including:
  - positive reviews
  - negative reviews
  - traveller type
  - ratings
 
## Methods & Models

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Feature engineering
- Baseline Dummy Classifier
- Logistic Regression (classification baseline)
- Random Forest (regression and classification)

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## Key Findings

- Service-related factors such as staff performance and cleanliness show the strongest
  correlation with overall hotel ratings.
- Hotel star classification alone does not fully determine perceived service quality.
- Amenities count and number of reviews play a secondary role compared to service consistency.
- Random Forest models outperform linear models by capturing non-linear relationships
  in customer evaluations.
