It was located in the city center, making it close to major attractions, restaurants and shopping. The interior of the hotel also left a deep impression on me. The hotel was furnished with excellent taste and the cozy atmosphere created a feeling of comfort and relaxation. The staff at AHMAD HOTEL were exceptionally friendly and helpful. They were always ready to help with any of my requests and questions. Special thanks for their professionalism and hospitality. The room I stayed in was clean and comfortable. I appreciated the comfortable bed and well-equipped bathroom. It is also worth noting that the breakfasts provided at the hotel were varied and delicious. I always started my day with a good meal. In addition, the cost of staying at the hotel was very reasonable considering the level of service and quality of services provided. I was very pleased with my stay at AHMAD HOTEL and will definitely consider it as my first choice when next visiting the city. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and welcoming place to stay.""","""However, one of the small drawbacks of the AHMAD HOTEL that is worth mentioning is that there is no possibility to order dinner in the evening. However, in compensation for this, they always hospitably treat guests with a variety of tasty treats and tea.

The towels were a washed-out gray color, with stains, I was disgusted even to touch them, the linen was washed-out, dirty gray. There was no kettle, no glass, no tea set, no spoon in the room, I had to ask the administrator for everything, considering that the rooms are cold, it was possible to provide a kettle and tea as a bonus, but this was not the case. I turned on the TV, but the switching buttons did not work, it says watch only one channel.
